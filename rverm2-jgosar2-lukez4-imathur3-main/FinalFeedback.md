    The presentation was clear and had all key components. The live demo was also very interesting. However, using code to go over your algorithms and project goals were not very informative, and it could be difficult for viewers to follow. I would suggest using some slides and graphs in the future.

    The report was very well written and easy to read. I also liked that you included both runtime and problem analysis.

    The readme has everything necessary. It is short and concise, but I would suggest to use some bullet points or breaklines to make it more clear. Also, since the dataset is not given in the code repo, it is also necessary to give out the link for the dataset.

    Great project overall. The project solved a very interesting problem. The testing cases for the algorithms are very thorough, and it is nice that you include several small graphs for each algorithm. 

    However, the code execuation was a little bit difficult. The instructions in README assume the user has everything needed from the git repo, but the dataset is not given in the indicated folder. It is ok to not including the dataset in git repo given the size of the dataset can be relativey large, but the README should clearly instruct the user where to donwload the datatset, and put under which folder.
