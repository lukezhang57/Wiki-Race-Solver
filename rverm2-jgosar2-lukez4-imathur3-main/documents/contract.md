<h1>Communication</h1>

1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet every Wednesday from 8 PM - 9 PM in person at Hendrick House.  Each meeting will last approximately 1 hour. We will take notes during the meeting to keep track of things to do for each week.

2. **Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through discord or phone calls. We commit to responding to messages within 24 hours outside of emergencies. 

3. **Respect:** Each member will participate in a “Standup Meeting”, that way each person can voice their opinions and talk about the progress they have made along with any roadblocks they are facing. Each member will commit to follow through and complete the tasks they are assigned. 

<h1>Collaboration</h1>

1. **Work Distribution:** We will assign tasks to do during each weekly meeting. Tasks will be assigned on a volunteer basis but if no one volunteers, we can assign tasks randomly. We will address unexpected complications by arranging more meetings.  

2. **Time Commitment:** Each group member is expected to work at least 2 hours and no more than 4 hours per week on the group project. If a conflict arises or if a task takes more time, then a meeting will be arranged to redistribute tasks and discuss for a potential solution. 

3. **Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts will be resolved by the winner of a generals.io FFA match. The settings shall be as follows: 3x speed, 1.0 City Density, 1.0 Mountain Density. Max Map Height and Map Width. If one or more members have not accomplished tasks, they will be expected to give an explanation and make up the work by the next meeting.
