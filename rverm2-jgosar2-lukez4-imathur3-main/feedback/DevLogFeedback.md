### Week March 28 ~ April 3

PASS

Impressive progress! You guys have already met the mid-checkin requirement. Keep up with the good work!

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Great work. For the mid-checkin, remmeber to write test cases for your data parsinga and traversal functions. Try to use some small dataset/graphs to verify your implementations. I am looking forward to see your results.

### Week April 11 ~ April 17

PASS

Great work! It is impressive that you wrote thorough test cases for both data parsing and graph implementations. One possible solution for long runtime porblem is that you can run the code just once, and save some varibales into local files so that you don't have to re-calculate the same varibales every time you run the code. Other than that, I will see you at mid-checkin.

### Week April 18 - April 24

PASS

Nice work. Good job on the mid-checkin.

### Week April 25 - May 1

PASS

Good job! Couple reminders for the final delivery:
- READ THE RUBRIC VERY CAREFULLY! (I am more than willing to give partial credits, but I cannot give out points that are clearly missing based on the rubric)
- In README, Make sure to mention how to run, compile, and test your code, and also where are all the files
- In write up, remember to decripe your algorithms' input/ouput, and problem solved by your algorithms. Explain the runtime of your algorithms.
- For your code, make sure your code can compile and run. There should be comments throught the code, and not junk codes.
- For the presentation, discuss your goal, method used, and individuals' conclusion thoughs. A powerpoint will be nice.
