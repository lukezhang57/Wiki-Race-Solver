### Comments

The proposal is very well-written, and it sounds like a very unique and interesting project. There are one major flaw in your algorithm part and two other minor flaws. Other than that, I am looking forward to see your result!

**Dataset**
- Could you elaborate how you plan to assign weights? More specifically, what do you mean by the frequency of hyperlinks between two articles? Is it the number of hyperlinks in article A that link to article B? Or is it something else?

**Algorithm**

- Could you elaborate more on the heuristic function in A* algorithm? Using Euclean distance will not be a sufficient heuristic function since it is equavalent to Dijkstra's algorithm and it will not be considered as an uncovered algorithm.

- Could you specify which basic traversal algorithm you will be using?
